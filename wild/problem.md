### Wildlife Conservation
Increasing urbanization and industrial use are diminishing natural habitats, leaving wild horses and other wildlife in New Mexico with limited space to thrive. The scarcity of open space and public lands causes an increase in overcrowding which has a negative impact on the eco system and limits the opportunities for people to connect with nature.  Wild horses inhabit just 17% of BLM land grazed by livestock, approximately 80% of the forage in the wild horse habitat is allocated to privately owned livestock.

### Wild Horse Relocation
Many wild horses across the state of New Mexico face the threat of removal from public lands and private lands and need safe, wild environments to live freely. The relocation space for wild horses to remain free and wild needs to be large enough to sustain a thriving naturally balanced eco-system for the horses and other wildlife living on the land.  Removing wild horses from the land and eliminating their numbers has a negative impact on the ability of the ecosystem to thrive.

### Community Need
Access to public lands and outdoor recreational space have become more limited and overcrowded. The space available for families to enjoy horse back riding, hiking and other outdoor activities has become increasingly restricted and overcrowded. There are areas across the state of New Mexico where wild horses have become overpopulated causing problems with habitat destruction, competition with cattle, water scarcity and the in-balance of the eco-system impacting other plants and wildlife.
